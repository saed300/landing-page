# Landing page

Project created using react, so use 'npm Run Start' to spin up the project.

Tools used: React, React-icons, hooks: useViewportscroll, useAnimation etc, Framer Motion, Intersection Observer, VSCode and chrome dev tools for responsivness.

Why: I used React because I wanted to utilize framer motion for some animations as it is a react based library. I used a small parallax effect on the main heading in the Home.JS. Once the user scrolls, not only does a parallax effect occur, but also by using scrollYProgress, when the user scrolls at a certain position, the color changes from black to white. Alternatively, I could have done this with CSS by adding/removing classes in the useEffect hook; but I wanted to challenge myself and use a new technology. I like learning new things! :) 

Time: 1.5/2hrs

Improvements: I would improve this could by adding more UI animations as well as possibly incorporating a video banner that enagages the user. I am also working on Three JS in my spare time so, in future, I would implement 3D animations. Moving on, although I used 1 photo, next time I would use a webP version with fallbacks too for different browsers, this is because WebP photo's are usually 35% smaller than jpeg's/png's. I would also use a placeholder Image and load the real image when the component renders. There is a library called 'React Progressive Image' which I have utilized in the past. This would be key when using a multitude of photos.
I made the website responsive for the majority of devices, next time I would make it universally responsive even for quirky devices such as the Galaxy Z Flip phone :-)

Thank you! :)
